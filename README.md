# Opportunity Set for Prospective Mobile App Developers

## Overview
This project was inspired by a Data Quest prompt and functions as a recommendation to prospective mobile app developers deciding on what type of app to create. The data used is pulled in from Kaggle and covers a sample of apps from the Apple Store and Google Play Store. Throughout the project, the data is cleaned and curated to include only free apps in English. From there, the competitive landscape and opportunity set is thoroughly analyzed for the edification of app developers looking to generate significant user engagement.
